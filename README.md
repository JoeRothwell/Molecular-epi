# Data analysis for molecular epidemiology projects

This repository is the codebase for molecular epidemiology projects on colorectal cancer, usually in the EPIC cohort. Code for other cancer studies was originally stored here, but this have now been moved to separate repos. See the wiki for further details and descriptions of analyses.

#### Metabolic signatures of healthy lifestyle and association with colorectal cancer in EPIC

The aim of this study was to determine a metabolic signature of cancer-preventing or cancer-promoting lifestyle according to the WCRF score as described by Romaguera et al (2012). PLS was used to determine the signature in a large group of control subjects from various EPIC case-control studies, for both Biocrates compounds and fatty acids. Once derived, colorectal cancer case-control status was modelled from these signatures, in the form of predicted scores, and compared to models using the original calculated scores to find if metabolic signature better predicts CRC than calculated score only.
