#### Metabolic signatures of healthy lifestyle and association with colorectal cancer in EPIC

The aim of this study was to determine a metabolic signature of cancer-preventing or cancer-promoting lifestyle according to the WCRF score as described by Romaguera et al (2012). PLS was used to determine the signature in a large group of control subjects from various EPIC case-control studies, for both Biocrates compounds and fatty acids. Once derived, colorectal cancer case-control status was modelled from these signatures, in the form of predicted scores, and compared to models using the original calculated scores to find if metabolic signature better predicts CRC than calculated score only.

#### Association of breast cancer and plasma metabolites in the E3N cohort

The aim of the study was to search for associations between plasma metabolite profiles and breast cancer risk in 1590 subjects from the E3N nested case-control study using 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) untargeted metabolomics.

#### Colorectal cancer and type 2 diabetes in the UK Biobank cohort

The aim of the study was to calculate associations between colorectal cancer, biomarkers of colorectal cancer and type 2 diabetes in the UK Biobank cohort.

#### A metabolomics study on liver cancer and coffee drinking in the ATBC study

Investigates associations between plasma metabolites, as identified by untargeted metabolomics, liver cancer and coffee drinking. Code here subsets and feature filters raw metabolomics data for the ATBC coffee study.
